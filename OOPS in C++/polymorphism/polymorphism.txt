In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person exhibits different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism

Compile time polymorphism --> function overloading and operator overloading
Runtime polymorphism --> function overriding and virtual function
